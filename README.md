# Online Library Microproject

This project is a simple **Online Library** application built using **Express.js** and **Node.js**. It demonstrates the use of a backend API to serve book data and a frontend static website to display the library's features. The project includes a well-designed user interface and interactive features for browsing and filtering books.
